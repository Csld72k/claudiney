01.  &lt;hr&gt; - The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule) element
The  &lt;hr&gt; HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.
Historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using appropriate CSS.;
