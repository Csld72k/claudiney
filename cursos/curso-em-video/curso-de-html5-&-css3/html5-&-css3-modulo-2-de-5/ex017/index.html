  <h1>Text alignment using CSS</h1>
  <p style="text-align: left;">This first paragraph will have the default left alignment.</p>
  <p style="text-align: right;">The second paragraph will be right-aligned.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">The third paragraph will be center aligned.</p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">The last paragraph will have justified alignment. In order for you to realize this, I
    will have
    to put a little bigger text. In case you don't notice that the alignment is being done on both sides,
    try decreasing the size of your browser a little. This type of alignment is often used for long texts.
    and large paragraphs, to give a sense of symmetry. Now I don't know what to write anymore, but I'll continue
    so that your text is large enough that you can see the justified alignment. never thought that
    it would be so hard to keep writing meaningless things just for an explanation to make a minimum of sense. Enough,
    For me it's over! I hope you were able to understand.</p>
