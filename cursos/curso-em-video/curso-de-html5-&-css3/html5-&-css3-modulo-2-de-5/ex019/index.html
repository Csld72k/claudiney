  <h2>Amazon launches its own Linux distribution</h2>

  <p>
    The commerce giant Amazon surprises once again and launches its own Linux distribution. the new system
    open source operating system is called Bottlerocket. However, very calm at this time. Before getting excited about
    distro and try to install it, you need to know that it doesn't work the same way as other 'normal' ones like
    Ubuntu, Debian or Fedora.
  </p>

  <h3>Meet Bottlerocket: Amazon's Linux Distribution for Running Containers</h3>

  <p class="dir">
    A lot has changed in the IT industry since the term cloud computing was first coined. It takes a few
    seconds to deploy a Linux server (usually running in a VM), thanks to server providers in
    cloud like Amazon AWS, Google, Linode, Digital Ocean etc. In addition, you can deploy applications and services
    on these servers in the form of containers thanks to tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The problem is, when your only goal is to run containers on a Linux system, you don't always need a
    Complete Linux distribution. That's why there are container-specific systems that only provide the
    required packages. This dramatically reduces operating system size and deployment time. O
    Bottlerocket Linux is specifically developed by Amazon Web Services to run containers on machines
    virtual or bare metal hosts. It supports docker images as well as others that follow the OCI image format.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Features of Bottlerocket Linux
  </h3>

  <p class="especial">
    No package-by-package updates. The traditional procedure of a Linux distribution is composed by
    updating individual packages. Bottlerocket uses image-based updates. Thanks to this approach,
    conflicts and crashes are avoided with the possibility of a quick and complete rollback (if necessary). System of
    read-only files. Bottlerocket also uses a read-only file system. your integrity is
    checked at boot time via dm-verity. For additional security measures, SSH access is also
    discouraged and only available through the admin container (additional mechanism).
  </p>

  <h3>
    Automated Updates
  </h3>

  <p class="meio especial"> <!-- This paragraph will have two classes: middle AND special -->
    You can automate Bottlerocket updates using an orchestration service like Amazon EKS. to amazon
    also claims that including only the essential software to run containers reduces the number of attacks on
    compared to general-purpose Linux distributions.
  </p>

  <h3>
    What do you think?
  </h3>

  <p class="esq"> <!-- It's okay for two paragraphs to be of the same class -->
    Amazon is not the first to create a 'container-specific Linux'. CoreOS was one of the first
    such distributions. CoreOS was acquired by Red Hat, which was then sold to IBM. Red Hat recently
    discontinued CoreOS and replaced it with Fedora CoreOS. Cloud server is a big industry that will continue to
    to grow. A giant like Amazon will do anything to stay abreast or ahead of its competitors. In my opinion,
    Bottlerocket is an answer to (now) IBM's Fedora CoreOS. Although Bottlerocket repositories are
    available on GitHub , it is still not possible to find one ready to create images. It is currently available
    just as a preview on AWS.
